<h1>Navigation Project</h1>
<p>Two training algorithms Deep Q-learning and Double DQN, are implemented. This report summarizes the training scores, performance with DDQN agent and comparison analysis from these two algorithms. </p>
<h3> Training Scores with Double DQN </h3>

<h3> Performance from DDQN agent </h3>
The average score for DDQN agent playing the game is 16.51 for 100 consecutive rounds.
<h3> Training Scores with DQN </h3>

<h3> Observations </h3>
Training with both algorithms was able to reach to score 15 around 500 episodes. Trainnig with Double DQN reached to score 15 slightly faster.
